## Torch_Pruning 

Code in this directory is borrowed from [https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning](https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning)

We use this code for partitioning the weights into structural groups and physically removing them once identified as pruning groups using our pruning algorithm.
